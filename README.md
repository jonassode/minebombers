Starting the server

cd ./server
./setup.sh
npm start

cd client
npm install --global http-server
http-server index.html 

Then hit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and that should take you to the test page

Open the console in the browser to see what happens

A test page which connects the users to the server and gets a player list back
All players get a player list message back when someone connects

Is a mess, just a proof of concept
